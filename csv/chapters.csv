The one its physical design tells is the founding of the city by religious reformers known as Puritans. The stones record lives long and short, tragic accidents, and loving tributes. The stories in the burying ground include the lives of people who have no markers. While as many as 6000 people once lay interred on the ancient grounds, nearly 500 of them indigenous, African, or African American, only a little over 400 have stones that survive.

Atlantic Connections,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Triangle_trade.png,Image: Wikimedia Commons,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Triangle_trade.png,"With or without headstones and footstones, the people buried in the Ancient Burying Ground were almost all intimately connected to the whole of the Atlantic Ocean. England began its colonial expansion in the seventeenth century with its first permanent settlements in the Chesapeake, New England, and the West Indies. It’s a story that has focused on the so-called “triangle trade” between England, the colonies, and the west coast of Africa, in which African slaves endured the middle passage to produce sugar, rice, tobacco, and other goods for the mother country. <br><br>Colonial era Hartford’s involvement in trade and other interactions with the West Indies was more varied and complex than most history books suggest. Earlier studies focused primarily on the export market. Hartford’s farmers shipped horses, meat, cheese, and other supplies to the Caribbean. Later, finished goods such as furniture also made the voyage. <br><br>Historians described Connecticut’s role in the “triangle trade” by focusing on the return of rum and molasses, not the human cargo that also arrived in Connecticut on those ships. Historical studies have also noted the disruptions to the Connecticut-West Indian trade during the American Revolution without paying attention to the effect of that upheaval on the people who inhabited the Caribbean plantations or on the practice of human trafficking.  The late Yale diplomatic historian, Gaddis Smith, summed up that historical perspective: “the West Indies [sugar] plantation [was the] market and the Connecticut farm [was] the supplier.” Yet the relationship was far more complex, and at its core was enslavement.

Enslaved Africans and occasionally “Spanish Indians” came from the West Indies to Connecticut. Captive Native and African people produced many of the supplies in Connecticut that went to the Caribbean and enslaved laborers produced the goods that came from the West Indies. <br><br>Commodities and people were not the only things exchanged between these two places. The English companies and colonists that settled New England were interested in finding new species of plants and animals in the West Indies, and began with Providence Island. Peoples’ customs, foodways, music and art traveled on those routes. Ideas also made the trip, from the religious experiments of the early settlers to the political ferment of two Atlantic revolutions.",,Hidden,,,,,,,,

Farming and Trade,media/Horse_DutchCob.jpg,Image: Dutch cob horse from an Alexander Anderson woodcut.,https://www.sport-horse-breeder.com/ARH-massachusetts-colony.html,"Commercial farming deepened the connections between the Connecticut River Valley and the Atlantic world because of the vast market in the West Indies for Connecticut's products. Bruce Daniels argued the desire to market crops enhanced specialization, and specialization increased the need for new markets. Beef, pork, and dairy production went to the Caribbean in staggering quantities. The trade was not one-way, and in the eighteenth-century Connecticut’s economy was wholly entangled with the large-scale human enslavement in the West Indies.<br><br>Connecticut's steady economic growth every twenty-five years after 1725 contrasts somewhat to the declining per capita trade in British North American. Per capita trade to the West Indies increased, and Connecticut's per capita growth was tied directly and indirectly to the West Indies trade. Moreover, the price of foodstuffs, Connecticut's main export, increased nearly fivefold after I740 relative to all other goods, encouraging merchants and farmers to increase their exports. This growth was uneven: trade did not increase between 1763 and I767 when England and France restricted access to Caribbean markets, was nearly eliminated by the British blockade during the Revolutionary War, and declined again at the end of the I780s owing to a glutted West Indian market and competition from other states.",,Hidden,,,,,,,,
